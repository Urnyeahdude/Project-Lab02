<p>Espresso is coffee brewed by forcing a small amount of nearly boiling water under pressure <br>
through finely ground coffee beans. Espresso is generally thicker than coffee brewed by other methods,<br>
has a higher concentration of suspended and dissolved solids, and has crema on top.<br>
As a result of the pressurized brewing process, the flavors and chemicals in a typical cup of espresso<br>
are very concentrated. Espresso is also the base for other drinks such as a caffè latte, cappuccino, <br>
caffè macchiato, caffè mocha, flat white, or caffè Americano.</p>
